## üöÄ Inspiration

Millions of people experience mild or ambiguous symptoms daily but aren't sure whether they need to see a doctor. In the age of AI, there's an opportunity to bridge this gap using conversational intelligence‚Äîproviding calm, non-alarming, and informed suggestions based on described symptoms.

---

## ü©∫ What It Does

The AI Health Assistant:
- Allows users to enter symptom descriptions in natural language.
- Uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model to analyze symptoms.
- Responds with possible interpretations and gentle suggestions.
- Advises when medical attention might be needed.
- Empowers users to make informed health decisions.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

- **Frontend**: Simple UI for users to input symptoms.
- **Backend**: Python Flask API (or FastAPI) to relay requests.
- **AI Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 (via `openai.ChatCompletion`) for inference.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on a cloud instance using Docker for portability.
- **Security**: API key protected and environment variables stored in `backend_config.py`.

## üß© Challenges We Ran Into

- Crafting accurate yet non-alarming prompts for the AI.
- Balancing generality with helpfulness in the AI‚Äôs responses.
- Avoiding medical misinformation‚Äîensuring users know this is *not* a substitute for a professional diagnosis.
- Ensuring fast, reliable inference with API rate limits.

## üìä Case Study Example

**Scenario:**  
A mother notices her child has a low-grade fever and stomach ache but isn‚Äôt sure if it‚Äôs serious.

**What she does:**  
She types the symptoms into the AI Health Assistant.

**AI Output:**  
The assistant calmly explains possible causes (like mild viral infection or indigestion), gives home care tips, and advises monitoring for 24 hours unless symptoms worsen.

**Result:**  
The mother feels reassured, observes symptoms, and consults a doctor the next day with better notes‚Äîreducing stress and improving care decisions.
